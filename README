codeml_parallel README

This pipeline is used to extract and align coding sequences from a GTF for input into codeml using different lineages as the foreground in parallel to identify evidence of selection acting on a particular species.
Coding sequences are extracted from a GTF using gffread: https://github.com/gpertea/gffread
Sequences are aligned using MUSCLE: https://www.drive5.com/muscle/
Sequence based test of selection performed using PAML: http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/software/paml.html
Parts of the script are adapted from existing script provided by Claire Dubin.

Scripts 1-5 are used to organize the CDS files, align using MUSCLE, convert to phylip format for input into PAML, and perform the likelihood ratio test to identify candidate genes.
Scripts not labeled with numbers are used in the numbered scripts to run in parallel.
